    <h1> PostgreSQL 9.0 beta packages are ready for testing</h1>
	<p>
	If you are a Fedora-7,8,9,11,12,13 or RHEL/CentOS 4,5 user and want to
        test new features of PostgreSQL 9.0 and help development, you 
	may use the packages that we will release for each beta release.
	</p><p>
	These are not stable packages. Use them at your own risk. <b>They 
	are not ready for production.</b>.
	</p><p>
	Please install repository RPMs from here first:
	</p><p>
	<a href="http://yum.pgrpms.org/reporpms/repoview/letter_p.group.html">http://yum.pgrpms.org/reporpms/repoview/letter_p.group.html</a>
	</p><p>
	Remove existing RPMs after taking your backups, and then install 
	9.0 packages. You may want to install -debuginfo RPM, which may 
	help PostgreSQL developers to get some data in case you find a 
	bug.
	</p><p>
	Source RPMs are also available:
	</p><p>
	<a href="http://yum.pgrpms.org/srpms/9.0">http://yum.pgrpms.org/srpms/9.0</a>
	(and they are installable using yum).
	</p><p>
	Please report any packaging related errors to <a 
	href=/contact.php">us</a>. If you find any PostgreSQL 9.0 bugs, 
	please post them to pgsql-bugs@PostgreSQL.org or fill out this 
	form: <BR>
