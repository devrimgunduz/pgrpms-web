    <h1> PostgreSQL 9.3 beta packages are ready for testing</h1>
	<p>
	If you are a Fedora 17,18 or RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux 5,6 user and want to
        test new features of PostgreSQL 9.3 and help development, you 
	may use the packages that we will push for each beta release.
	</p><p>
	These are not stable packages. Use them at your own risk. <b>They 
	are not ready for production.</b>.
	</p><p>
	Please install repository RPMs from here first:
	</p><p>
	<a href="http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php#pg93">http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php#pg93</a>
	</p><p>
	Please note that you can install 9.3 packages along with your 9.0+ packages.
	You may also want to install -debuginfo RPM, which may 
	help PostgreSQL developers to get some data in case you find a 
	bug.
	</p><p>
	Source RPMs are also available:
	</p><p>
	<a href="http://yum.postgresql.org/srpms/9.3">http://yum.postgresql.org/srpms/9.3</a>
	(and they are installable using yum).
	</p><p>
	Please report any packaging related errors to <a 
	href=/contact.php">us</a>. If you find any PostgreSQL 9.3 bugs, 
	please post them to pgsql-bugs@PostgreSQL.org or fill out this 
	form: <BR>
